Machine Learning Notes

Welcome to my Machine Learning Notes repository!
This section contains my personal notes, explanations, and summaries from various ML topics â€” organized to make revision and concept understanding easier.

Overview

These notes cover the core concepts of Machine Learning, including both theoretical understanding and practical intuition behind the algorithms.

They are written in simple language, supported with formulas, diagrams, and examples.
