Machine Learning Algorithms — Classical Models

Welcome to my repository on Classical Machine Learning Models!
This repo contains implementations and experiments with foundational ML algorithms used for regression and classification tasks.

 Overview

This project is part of my ongoing learning and practice in Machine Learning fundamentals.
Each model is implemented from scratch (or using libraries like scikit-learn) with clear explanations, comments, and example datasets.

 Algorithms Covered
🔹 Linear Regression
🔹 Logistic Regression
🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
🔹 Naive Bayes
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
🔹 K-Means Clustering
🔹 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
